This is essentially an experiment/prototype that got a little too big and had some potential. So it's being turned into a project.

proto.py is the original prototype.

protodeploy is the original exerimental deploy script that worked for at least two of the django apps I work on.


```shell
poetry run protodeploy
```

```shell
poetry run start
```

```shell
poetry run protocheckdb
```

```shell
poetry run protogetkeys
```

```shell
poetry run protogetdbcluster
```

```shell
poetry run protoselectcluster
```

```shell
poetry run protoselect_spaces
```
